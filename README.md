## Project Overview

The **System Threat Forecaster** is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting potential security threats or system vulnerabilities by analyzing system logs and related data. This project is part of the Machine Learning Practice (BSCS2008P) course under the BS Degree in Data Science and Applications at IIT Madras.

## Objectives

- Develop a predictive model to forecast system threats using historical and real-time data.
- Apply data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to prepare the dataset.
- Experiment with multiple classification algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Optimize the model through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

---

## Dataset

- The dataset comprises system logs and records of past threats or vulnerabilities.
- Data cleaning and feature extraction steps are performed to handle missing values and extract relevant indicators.

## Working 

- Started with EDA, feature engineering, data cleaning.
- Built a baseline model(Logistic Regression) to evaluate initial performance.
- Worked on different models like Random forest, decision trees.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning.
- Finally generated predictions using the best ensemble (Voting Classifier) for submission.
  

## Results 

- Achieved best score of 0.61 during entire project.
- Secured A grade in the project course.
